Use a Virtual Environment for Isolated Installations:

If you prefer not to install packages system-wide:

    Create a Virtual Environment:

    bash

python3 -m venv myenv

Activate the Environment:

bash

source myenv/bin/activate

Now, within this virtual environment, you can use pip to install torch without the externally managed environment warning:

bash

    python3 -m pip install torch
    python3 -m pip install matplotlib
    python3 -m pip install numpy
    python3 -m pip install graphviz

    brew install graphviz


This approach keeps your installations isolated and avoids conflicts with system-wide packages.
